The premise of `phrasenets` is very simple: to help you build "phrase nets." These are very easy, in fact, if you know your way around you probably won't need this package at all.

## What are "phrase nets"

It's almost too simple, it connects words according to "connectors" of your choosing, e.g.:

- "A to B"
- "A and B"
- "B at C"

```{r setup}
library(phrasenets)

data(reuters)

reuters %>% 
  phrase_net(text) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(preceding != "the") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(following != "the") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(occurences > quantile(occurences, .75)) %>% 
  plot_sigmajs()
```
